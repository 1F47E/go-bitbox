# AESpass ðŸ”’
```
A command line tool for encrypting and decrypting text using a password. 

The output is base64 encoded.
```

## Why use a password instead of a key?

AESpass uses the scrypt key derivation function to transform the user-provided password into a 32-byte key suitable for use with AES.

## How it works

AESpass uses AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for encryption and decryption. GCM is a mode of operation for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers that provides authenticity and confidentiality.

## Usage

```bash
NAME:
   AESpass - Encrypt and Decrypt text with AES using password. Encrypted result is base64 encoded

USAGE:
   aespass [command] text password

COMMANDS:
   encrypt, e  Encrypt a string
   decrypt, d  Decrypt a string
```

## Examples

Encrypt a string with the password 12345678:
```
aespass e secret 123456789
```
Output:
```
WOx69r3Y1a0qNqZGvwG44eJ5FaU+xyHjPdFDt8klThlrZ5m1o7rG3tMztr8KibXMfN4UW3m/dfLyCmimnyQPX3f5
```

Decrypt a string with the password 12345678:

```
aespass d WOx69r3Y1a0qNqZGvwG44eJ5FaU+xyHjPdFDt8klThlrZ5m1o7rG3tMztr8KibXMfN4UW3m/dfLyCmimnyQPX3f5 12345678
```
Output:
```
secret
```
