```
A command line tool written in Go for encrypting and decrypting text using a password. 

```

## How it works

Bitbox uses [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) in [Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) for encryption and decryption. GCM is a mode of operation for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers that provides authenticity and confidentiality.

## Usage

```bash
NAME:
   bitbox - Encrypt and Decrypt text with AES using password. Encrypted result is base64 encoded string

USAGE:
   bitbox [command] text password

COMMANDS:
   encrypt, e  Encrypt a string
   decrypt, d  Decrypt a string
```

## Examples

Encrypt a string "secret_string" with the password 12345678:
```
bitbox e secret_string 123456789
```
Output:
```
WOx69r3Y1a0qNqZGvwG44eJ5FaU+xyHjPdFDt8klThlrZ5m1o7rG3tMztr8KibXMfN4UW3m/dfLyCmimnyQPX3f5
```

Decrypt a base64 string with the password 12345678:

```
bitbox d WOx69r3Y1a0qNqZGvwG44eJ5FaU+xyHjPdFDt8klThlrZ5m1o7rG3tMztr8KibXMfN4UW3m/dfLyCmimnyQPX3f5 12345678
```
Output:
```
secret_string
```
